    <p> Existential crisis time. Do I even have a personality? I was 
        struggling to come up with blog post ideas because I'm either
    too scared to share things I actually think about or like or because
my days are just occupied with homework and sleep and feeling empty. 
I should actually be coding instead of writing these fake blog posts. 
But let me have a diva moment just for a second geez. Like what if I don't 
think actual original thoughts? This blog post is proof of contradiction... 
right? Or did I just steal this personality from someone... who knows. Oh well. </p>
